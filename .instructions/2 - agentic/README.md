# Setup
1. Ensure that the Github Copilot extension is installed and logged in
2. Ensure Copilot is in agent mode
3. Ensure Sonnet 4 is selected as the LLM to use
4. Add the Github MCP in remote mode
5. Ensure the vscode terminal integration works. Ask Copilot to test it out.

# Workflow
1. We will implement https://github.com/deanillfeld/ai-assisted-development-demo/issues/1
2. Develop a plan, save it to a file and then have Copilot execute it.
3. Have copilot iterate on its own through the code -> test -> fix cycle.
4. Have copilot raise a PR.
